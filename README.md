# E-Commerce Product & User Behavioral Analytics

A complete analytics project simulating how a business or data analyst might explore and segment user behavior on an e-commerce platform.

## Project Overview

This notebook walks through a full data analysis pipeline built in Python, using a simulated dataset of users, products, and event logs. It mirrors the kind of workflow commonly used in product and business analytics teams: from data ingestion to segmentation, visualization, and insight storytelling.

The goal? To build a reusable, structured, and scalable approach to data-driven product intelligence.

## Key Learnings & Takeaways

- Understanding engagement behavior is essential: one of the user segments interacts a lot... but never buys. Not ideal for your CAC.
- Product interest and purchase activity don’t always correlate. Sometimes, what people look at most isn’t what they end up buying.
- Segmenting users helped reveal category preferences by cluster. This is exactly the kind of finding that supports personalization strategy.
- A pipeline like this is generalizable: any company with users and events can plug in their data and adapt the same logic.

## Tools & Tech

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Google Colab / Jupyter
- K-Means clustering
- GitHub for versioning

## Code Commentary

This notebook is commented with both technical explanations and business context: the “how” and the “why” are always paired. The analysis is not just functional, it’s purposeful — and aims to bring clarity for anyone reading through the flow, even without a technical background.

I built this project as a demonstration of applied analytics thinking. It reflects how I would approach internal product usage data, user segmentation, or funnel optimization in a real role.

## What's Next?

This type of analysis is a foundation. It could easily be extended to include:

- Predictive modeling: churn, conversion, lifetime value
- Recommendation systems
- Dashboarding for stakeholders (Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit)
- Experimentation design and test impact tracking

This project reflects my way of working: focused, insight-driven, and structured — with enough curiosity to dig deeper, and enough pragmatism to ship.
